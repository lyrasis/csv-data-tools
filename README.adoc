Tools for working with CSV data (or other basic tabular data formats)

toc::[]

== chars_in_field.rb

A silly utility script to output a list of unique characters used in specified field(s) of a CSV, or the whole CSV if no fields are specified.

Initial use case: find all characters used in CollectionSpace media file names, so I could replace any characters unsafe for use in S3 key names with something else.

Do `ruby chars_in_field.rb -h` for usage details.

== `check_structure.rb`
NOTE: Supports comma, tab, or pipe delimited files currently

* Writes out a report on whether the rows of a CSV all have the same number of columns
* If a file has any ragged rows, it tells you how many columns the weird rows have and gives you the row numbers of up to 3 rows having that number of columns.
* Where the example field for a non-ok file is blank, that's the expected/correct number of columns based on the number of headers

== `compact_csvs.rb`

Rewrites CSV files, omitting any columns having no values. See usage comments at top of script.

== `compile_profiled.rb`

WARNING: This initial version is very specific to the CSU project, but this might be generalizable for other uses.

Generates a multi-tabbed Excel worksheet compiling:

* unique variable values used in non-id and non-date fields, with per-data-source and total occurrence counts for each value
* unique id patterns used in id fields
* unique date patterns used in date fields

The main value of this tool is found if:

* you have *multiple clients/users/data sources* with data sets that use the same data input template(s) or metadata standard

It allows you to get an overview of data to answer questions like:

* has this field been used in generally the same way across data sources?
* where two data input templates have the same field name/column header, has that field been used consistently across the templates?

See https://3.basecamp.com/3410311/buckets/38281121/cloud_files/8346461511#__recording_8347588463[this locked-to-Lyrasis Basecamp file description] for details on what this produces and how you might use it.

Assumes you have generated profile detail files for all data sources by running:

`ruby profiler.rb -i ~/data/export/ -o ~/data/profiled -s tsv -c '{col_sep: "\t"} -d compiled'`

The output path from the above will be the input path for this script.


== `convert_encoding.rb`

WARNING: script not finished. **Do not use yet**

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you have not installed or used the `charlock_holmes` gem before, you need to:
* install icu4c if you do not have it:

`brew install icu4c`

* run the following command in your terminal before running this script:

`bundle config build.charlock_holmes --with-icu-dir=/usr/local/opt/icu4c`
====

== `empty_columns.rb`

Initially, works on a single CSV file. Outputs to STDOUT a list of column headers where there are literally no data values in the column (i.e. column value is nil or an empty string).

Use case: quick list for use in quotes/estimates.

NOTE: Isn't smart enough to recognize stuff like "This column value is always `0` so it's probably a default value automatically set by the source system and doesn't mean anything"

== `field_signatures.rb`

"Field signature" refers to "the fields in a row that are actually populated."

Given a path to a CSV file, this script generates a new CSV that lets you see what field signatures are used in the source file. Number of occurrences and example IDs of records having each field signature are output, along with one column per source file column. If the column has "X" then it's populated in the field signature.

You will need to customize the `ID_HEADERS` variable in the script to include the name of any column(s) in your file that should be treated as row IDs.

== `file_info.rb`

Given path to a directory, a file suffix, and an optional minimum file size (in bytes)...

Prints to screen a the following info for all files with suffix in the directory:

* size
* result of unix `file` command (file encoding, presence of "very long lines," line terminators)

Do `ruby file_info.rb -h` for parameters/options.

Example output:

----
dbo_ZLocalUseAttribs.txt:
  size: 814242
  info: Little-endian UTF-16 Unicode text, with CRLF line terminators


dbo_ZResultFields.txt:
  size: 13274
  info: Little-endian UTF-16 Unicode text, with CRLF line terminators


dbo_dtproperties.txt:
  size: 34462
  info: Little-endian UTF-16 Unicode text, with very long lines, with CRLF line terminators
----

== `find_ctrl_chars.rb`

Works on one file at a time. Reports out any non-EOL characters in https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/category/Cc[the Unicode Control category], in context so the locations can be found in file.

WARNING: output is weird for combined/composed characters, but currently works ok enough for identifying issues that I'm not putting more time into fixing it.

Do `ruby find_ctrl_chars.rb -h` for parameters/options.

== `populated_columns.rb`

Initially, works on a single CSV file. Outputs to STDOUT a list of column headers where there is at least one non-empty/nil value in the column.

Use case: quick list for use in quotes/estimates.

== `profiler.rb`

Usage example: Defaults:

`ruby profiler.rb -i ~/data/export/ -o ~/data/profiled`

All `.csv` files in `~/data/export` directory are included, and the default details mode is `files`. Default options sent to Ruby standard library CSV parser are:

[source,ruby]
----
{headers: true, header_converters: [:downcase], converters: [:stripplus],
  skip_blanks: true, empty_value: nil}
----

Usage example: compiled details for tab-separated .tsv files:

`ruby profiler.rb -i ~/data/export/ -o ~/data/profiled -s tsv -c '{col_sep: "\t"} -d compiled'`

All `.tsv` files in `~/data/export` directory are included. The Ruby standard library CSV parser option `col_sep: "\t"` is merged into the default option hash shown above.

=== When `--details file`

One `.csv` file written to output directory per table column.

For example, if source file `addresses.csv` has a `:city` column, there is an `address_city.csv` file written.

The output CSV has one row per unique value found in the source column. The first column is the occurrence count of the value in the source column. The second column is the value.

=== When `--details compile`
Given a directory containing CSV files, writes out two CSV reports:

* summary - a row for each column in source CSVs, with the following columns:
** table - source CSV name
** column - column name
** column index - for putting them in the order in which they appear in source document
** uniq vals - count of unique values found in column
** null vals - count of empty cells in column

* details - a row for each unique value in each column in source CSVs, with the following columns:
** table - source CSV name
** column - column name
** column index - for putting them in the order in which they appear in source document
** value - a unique value found in column (puts "NULL VALUE/EMPTY FIELD" to represent that)
** occurrences - number of time value occurs in column

WARNING: There's a known bug where not all apparently empty fields are getting counted as "NULL VALUE/EMPTY FIELD". The number that get left out is small and I didn't have time to chase this down now, but will try to the next time I need this thing.

== `reformat_csv.pl`

[[reformatcsv]]Reformats a list of CSVs, allowing you to change the separator and escape characters.  Output is to STDOUT.

[TIP]
====
This can handle parsing `\n` inside quoted fields that contain unescaped quotes. We did not find a Ruby CSV parsing solution that handled this particular flavor of CSV horror. _(Thanks, potential client legacy system which shall not be named...)_

To run this script on all files in a directory, writing the reformatted files to another directory, see <<reformattables,`reformat_tables.rb`>>.
====

Usage: `reformat_csv.pl [options] FILES`

Usage example: `perl reformat_csv.pl --input_sep ';' --input_esc '#' ~/data/test.csv > ~/data/test_fix.csv`

.Options:
- input_sep - Separator character in input CSVs (default: ,)
- input_esc - Escape character in input CSVs (default: ")
- output_sep - Separator character in output CSVs (default: ,)
- output_esc - Escape character in output CSVs (default: ")

TIP: To pass TAB as `input_sep` or `output_sep`, use the literal tab character by typing `Ctrl-v`, then `TAB` on the command line.

While handy, this program primarily exists to take adavantage of Text::CSV_XS's ability to deal with unescaped quotes in fields. To do this, set input_esc to anything other than '"', for instance '#'.

*Requires you have the Text::CSV_XS Perl module installed*

== `reformat_tables.rb`

[[reformattables]]This is a wrapper around `reformat_csv.pl`. *It requires you have Perl and the `Text::CSV_XS` module installed.*

The input/output sep and esc options are the same as described for <<reformatcsv,`reformat_csv.pl`>>

The only required argument is `--input` (or `-i`), which specifies the directory containing the tabular data files you wish to reformat.

If no `--output`/`-o` value is given, a new directory called `reformatted` is created in your `--input` directory, and reformatted files are saved in new directory. Any other directory value can be provided. If the directory does not exist at run time, it will be created.

File suffix (`--suffix`/`-s`) defaults to `csv`.

Usage example:

`ruby reformat_tables.rb -i ~/data/lafayette/export --input_sep ';' --input_esc "#" --output_sep '    '`

Writes semicolon delimited .csv files with unescaped quotes to tab-delimited.

== `show_rows_with_column_ct.rb`

Meant to be used to investigate specific files reported by `clean_convert_report.rb` as having bad structure (i.e. ragged columns: some row having different number of columns than other rows)

Given path to file, delimiter name, number of columns you want to see rows for, and option number of rows you want to see...

Outputs to screen rows with the given number of columns.

This is useful for coming up with the specific find/replace mess you are going to have to implement to keep rows from being broken up in a ragged way.

Generally I use this iteratively with edits made to a migration-specific copy of `clean_convert_report.rb` to eliminate or minimize the number of ragged-column files I end up having to manually fix for a migration.

== `tables_and_columns.rb`

Utility script for creating data review spreadsheet.

Given a directory containing tabular data files, writes an .xlsx file with 2 tabs:

* tables
** table
** column ct
** row ct

* columns
** table
** column name

Do `ruby tables_and_columns.rb -h` for parameters/options.

== `table_preview.rb`

Useful for initial data review work.

Reads all files with given file suffix in the given directory. For each, prints out the file/table name, headers, and the first X (set max num of rows when script is run) rows of data, nicely formatted, in one text file you can scroll/search through. You don't have to open a million files to get your head around the general shape and character of the data.

*Requires `csvlook` from https://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html[csvkit] to be installed and available in your PATH*

Do `ruby table_preview.rb -h` for parameters/options.
