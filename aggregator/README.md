CSV Aggregator
==============

This tool includes a class and methods for aggregating multiple CSV datasets together. It specializes in processing heterogenous datasets (datasets with varying columns). The result is a CSV with all possible columns and all rows aggregated together. See `run_aggregate.rb` for an example implementation.
